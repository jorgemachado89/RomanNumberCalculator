# OptioPay - Roman Numbers

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Dependencies

In order to setup this project just run:
```
> npm install
```

To check out the test suites developed run:
```
> npm start
```

To boot the development environment run:
```
> npm start
```

For getting a production build run:
```
> npm build
```

## Implementation Decisions

* A label containing an Error message will be displayed if any of the inputs are invalid.
	* For checking existing scenarios where such an error may appear please check the test suites.
* Solution was tested for very large roman number inputs, but there is so much the current solution, by means of recursion, can handle :)
